M5Stack CM4Stack
================

There are several guides for CM4Stack developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
https://docs.m5stack.com/zh_CN/quick_start/cm4stack/develop first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://docs.m5stack.com/zh_CN/products/cm4stack/develop

There are various text files in the quick_start/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the quick_start/cm4stack/develop file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the machine, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your machine.
